	    Body element is used by impress.js to set some useful class names, that will allow you to detect
	    the support and state of the presentation in CSS or other scripts.
	    
	    First very useful class name is `impress-not-supported`. This class means, that browser doesn't
	    support features required by impress.js, so you should apply some fallback styles in your CSS.
	    It's not necessary to add it manually on this element. If the script detects that browser is not
	    good enough it will add this class, but keeping it in HTML means that users without JavaScript
	    will also get fallback styles.
	    
	    When impress.js script detects that browser supports all required features, this class name will
	    be removed.
	    
	    The class name on body element also depends on currently active presentation step. More details about
	    it can be found later, when `hint` element is being described.
	    
	-->
	<body class="impress-not-supported">

	<!--
	    For example this fallback message is only visible when there is `impress-not-supported` class on body.
	-->
	<div class="fallback-message">
	    <p>Your browser <b>doesn't support the features required</b> by impress.js, so you are presented with a simplified version of this presentation.</p>
	    <p>For the best experience please use the latest <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Safari</b> or <b>Firefox</b> browser.</p>
	</div>

	<!--
	    
	    Now that's the core element used by impress.js.
	    
	    That's the wrapper for your presentation steps. In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
	    It doesn't have to be a `<div>`. Only `id` is important here as that's how the script find it.
	    
	    You probably won't need it now, but there are some configuration options that can be set on this element.
	    
	    To change the duration of the transition between slides use `data-transition-duration="2000"` giving it
	    a number of ms. It defaults to 1000 (1s).
	    
	    You can also control the perspective with `data-perspective="500"` giving it a number of pixels.
	    It defaults to 1000. You can set it to 0 if you don't want any 3D effects.
	    If you are willing to change this value make sure you understand how CSS perspective works:
	    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/perspective
	    
	    But as I said, you won't need it for now, so don't worry - there are some simple but interesting things
	    right around the corner of this tag ;)

	    Last, but not least.
	    
	    To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
	    I strongly encourage to minify it first.
	    
	    In here I just include full source of the script to make it more readable.
	    
	    You also need to call a `impress().init()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
	    And you should do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also
	    because it should be done when the whole document is ready.
	    Of course you can wrap it in any kind of "DOM ready" event, but I was too lazy to do so ;)
	    
	-->
	<script src="js/impress.js"></script>
	<script>impress().init();</script>

	<!--
	    
	    The `impress()` function also gives you access to the API that controls the presentation.
	    
	    Just store the result of the call:
	    
	        var api = impress();
	    
	    and you will get three functions you can call:
	    
	        `api.init()` - initializes the presentation,
	        `api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,
	        `api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation,
	        `api.goto( idx | id | element, [duration] )` - moves the presentation to the step given by its index number
	                id or the DOM element; second parameter can be used to define duration of the transition in ms,
	                but it's optional - if not provided default transition duration for the presentation will be used.
	    
	    You can also simply call `impress()` again to get the API, so `impress().next()` is also allowed.
	    Don't worry, it wont initialize the presentation again.
	    
	    For some example uses of this API check the last part of the source of impress.js where the API
	    is used in event handlers.

    Now you know more or less everything you need to build your first impress.js presentation, but before
    you start...
    
    Oh, you've already cloned the code from GitHub?
    
    You have it open in text editor?
    
    Stop right there!
    
    That's not how you create awesome presentations. This is only a code. Implementation of the idea that
    first needs to grow in your mind.
    
    So if you want to build great presentation take a pencil and piece of paper. And turn off the computer.
    
    Sketch, draw and write. Brainstorm your ideas on a paper. Try to build a mind-map of what you'd like
    to present. It will get you closer and closer to the layout you'll build later with impress.js.
    
    Get back to the code only when you have your presentation ready on a paper. It doesn't make sense to do
    it earlier, because you'll only waste your time fighting with positioning of useless points.
    
    If you think I'm crazy, please put your hands on a book called "Presentation Zen". It's all about 
    creating awesome and engaging presentations.
    
    Think about it. 'Cause impress.js may not help you, if you have nothing interesting to say.

    I'm impressed! Feel free to let me know that you got that far (I'm @bartaz on Twitter), 'cause I'd like
    to congratulate you personally :)
    
    But you don't have to do it now. Take my advice and take some time off. Make yourself a cup of coffee, tea,
